    "left_page_top_content": "In 1936, Ted and Alice Sliger bought a ten-acre parcel of undeveloped desert outside of Mesa’s eastern city limits. This acreage was located on one of Arizona’s major tourist routes connecting the Salt River Valley with attractions in south and central Arizona, the Mogollon Rim in the north, and the White Mountains in eastern Arizona. In 1939, the Sligers dug a well on their property. Instead of finding cool drinking water, they tapped into a mineral-rich thermal spring that gushed at 112 degrees Fahrenheit. ",
    "left_page_bottom_content": "Recognizing its potential, Ted and Alice began turning the property into a tourist attraction. They built a bathhouse that could accommodate seventy-five visitors a day. The Giants discovered the Buckhorn Baths in 1947, and it served as the Giants’ pre-spring training camp until 1972. The Giants were always greeted at the Buckhorn with a banner saying, “Welcome to the Buckhorn New York Giants” (and later San Francisco). ",
    "right_page_top_content": "Giants owner Horace Stoneham considered the Sligers part of the Giants family and even invited them to join the team on a 1960 Goodwill Tour to Japan. When the New York Giants made it to the World Series in 1954, a local news story credited the Sligers’ baths with kicking off the Giants’ march toward the pennant. The story said the Buckhorn 'provided hot baths for the sweating off of winter suet and an expert group of masseuses.",
    "right_page_bottom_content": "The Sligers and the Buckhorn Baths are frequently cited as key players in attracting the Cactus League, a multi-million-dollar economic engine for the state of Arizona. The Buckhorn Baths closed in 1999 after sixty years of continuous operation. In 2005, the Buckhorn Mineral Baths and Wildlife Museum was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.",

Located at the northwest corner of Main Street and Mesa Drive, the mill allowed local farmers to grind their grain into flour more easily, rather than traveling to Tempe or Phoenix.",
    "left_page_bottom_content": "The mill initially produced grist for flour, corn meal, and poultry feed. In the 1930s, the production expanded to include wheat, oats, barley, and milo, supporting the local agricultural community even further.",
    "right_page_top_content": "Over time, the mill became a vital part of Mesa’s farming economy. However, it was torn down in 1968 after decades of service to the region. The site transitioned with the city’s growth and modernization.",

    "left_page_top_content": "The original Lehi School, built in the 1880s on land donated by the Rogers family, was a small one-room adobe building. By the early 1910s, the little community had outgrown the adobe schoolhouse. A new building was constructed in 1913 and the adobe schoolhouse was demolished. The school was expanded in the 1920s with the addition of two new classrooms.",
    "left_page_bottom_content": "During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Works Progress Administration made more improvements to the school. This included building an auditorium and an annex, which gave the school more space and purpose. The auditorium was so well built that during the Cold War, it was designated as the community bomb shelter. In the 1950s, the school’s first mechanical cooling system was installed in the main building.",
    "right_page_top_content": "Despite many improvements, the Lehi School was condemned by the Mesa School District in 1976. It was originally slated for destruction. However, officials discovered that tearing down the sturdy auditorium would cost more than rebuilding on the site. The City of Mesa stepped in and purchased the property.",
    "right_page_bottom_content": "In 1986, the city resold the site to the Mesa Historical Museum. This helped save the historic school from demolition. Today, the Lehi School stands as a reminder of the community’s early commitment to education and historic preservation, showcasing decades of Mesa’s school history.",

Before it was built, members had to travel all the way to Utah to visit the nearest temple. Located at Main Street and LeSueur Street, construction began in 1922. The temple was completed and dedicated in October 1927, marking an important milestone for the Latter-day Saints community in Arizona.",
    "left_page_bottom_content": "Since its opening, the temple has been rededicated twice for renovations, once in 1975 and again in 2021. Over the years, it has played a central role in the community and in the lives of its members. The Mesa Temple was the first to present the endowment ceremony in a language other than English, offering it in Spanish in 1945. For many years, it was also called the “Lamanite Temple” because it became a destination for annual excursions by both Hispanic and Native American Church members.",
    "right_page_top_content": "The Church held a competition to choose the temple's design, and the winning entry came from Don Carlos Young Jr. and Ramm Hansen. The plan was announced in 1919, only seven years after Arizona became a state. It was one of three temples announced and built to serve distant Latter-day Saint settlements in the early 20th century. The Mesa Temple represented a major step for Church members in the region.",
    "right_page_bottom_content": "Unlike earlier temples, the Mesa Temple was built in a neoclassical style inspired by the Temple in Jerusalem, featuring strong, simple lines and lacking the spires found on many other temples. This unique architectural choice set the Mesa Temple apart, making it a landmark in Mesa and a symbol of the Church's growth and adaptation in Arizona.",

As a young man, Stapley worked as both a farmer and a stagecoach driver. By the early 1900s, he was serving as a councilman in Mesa and as a trustee on the Mesa School Board. In 1893, Stapley established 'O.S. Stapley’s,' a hardware store in Mesa. By the 1940s, his mercantile business had grown to become the largest in Arizona.",
    "left_page_bottom_content": "Tragedy struck on January 11, 1906, when a major fire consumed five businesses in Mesa, including Stapley’s store. The fire started in a neighboring furniture store, Passey & Metz, and became worse when black powder stored in Stapley’s shop exploded. Despite this setback, the store prospered between 1906 and 1911, especially after Stapley secured a government contract to supply tools and hardware for the Roosevelt Dam construction. In 1908, he became the local dealer for International Harvester Company, which had just formed, and eventually became the largest IHC dealer in the country.",
    "right_page_top_content": "In June 1912, O.S. Stapley and Company opened a second store at Robson and Main in Mesa. They moved the furniture stock to this new location but kept the original store for hardware. In October of the same year, Stapley sold the furniture side of the business to J.W. Clark and J.S. Rogers, leading to the establishment of the O.S. Stapley Company. His hardware business continued to grow, expanding beyond Mesa.",
    "right_page_bottom_content": "Stapley’s enterprise opened a second store in Phoenix in 1917 and a third store in Glendale in 1919. He would later add two more locations in Chandler and Buckeye. Through hard work and innovation, O.S. Stapley built a business legacy that helped shape the commercial landscape of Arizona. His impact on the region is still remembered today.",
